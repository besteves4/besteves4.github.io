2025 marked my second attendance of the [Extended Semantic Web Conference (ESWC 2025)](https://2025.eswc-conferences.org/)
and was it a good one! Besides the opportunity to meet friends and colleagues once again, the highlight for me was without
doubts the opportunity to attend the [1st OPAL workshop](https://opal-workshop.github.io/2025/) where 
[ODRL](https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-model/) was the star of the show!

Here are some notes from OPAL and the conference in general. Needless to say, I am already looking forward to the next one ðŸ˜Š

### OPAL 2025 at ESWC 2025

The [ODRL And Beyond: Practical Applications And Challenges For Policy-Based Access And Usage Control (OPAL 2025)](https://opal-workshop.github.io/2025/)
workshop was for the very first time organised at the [Extended Semantic Web Conference (ESWC 2025)](https://2025.eswc-conferences.org/)
by the lovely
[Andrea Cimmino](https://oeg.fi.upm.es/index.php/en/phd/389-acimmino/index.html),
[Nicoletta Fornara](https://search.usi.ch/en/people/542f4f5b9685647629421ff52b1bff53/fornara-nicoletta),
[VÃ­ctor RodrÃ­guez-Doncel](https://cosasbuenas.es), and
[John Domingue](https://kmi.open.ac.uk/people/member/john-domingue),
with a call for contributions focus on topics like
- Data governance and management in centralised and decentralised Knowledge Graphs
- Policy enforcement and conflict resolution in real-world applications
- Formalization of user and organisational preferences for data sharing using [ODRL](https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-model/)

and more. Throughout the day, the workshop had an average of 17 attendees, which had the opportunity to see the presentations of
8 regular and 2 short papers. The proceedings of the workshop are now online at 
[https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3977/](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3977/), so you can check out all contributions there.

Beyond that, there was a round table to discuss current challenges and futures directions for [ODRL](https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-model/),
which are summarised [here](https://github.com/opal-workshop/2025/issues).
These will prove themselves as very useful to guide new discussions at the [W3C ODRL CG](https://www.w3.org/community/odrl/) 
and hopefully will help shape any new iterations of [ODRL](https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-model/).

Here's a nice picture of the OPAL attendees!

Finally, here are some highlights of the workshop (they reflect my opinion only ðŸ˜‰)

#### Terms of Service as ODRL policies

The first highlight of the workshop was hearing about the work that Elena Molino-PenÌƒa *et al.*
are doing around Terms of Service. Check out their [paper](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3977/OPAL2025-10.pdf) and
the [Terms of Service Language ontology (TOSL)](https://w3id.org/tosl).

Their focus was on building an [ODRL profile](https://w3c.github.io/odrl/profile-bp/)
to tackle the representation of contractual terms of Software as a Service Terms of Service (ToS),
enabling the precise definition of terms related to arbitration, applicable law, content removal,
liability and modification/termination clauses.
The ultimate goal is to prevent the inclusion of unfair terms in ToSs
and support legal requirements such as the ones coming from the
[EU Directive on Unfair Contract Terms](http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2019/2161/oj).

The [Terms of Service Language ontology (TOSL)](https://w3id.org/tosl) proved itself useful to model real-world use cases,
as well as a basis to detect abusive terms.
Check out a cool example derived from [GitHubâ€™s ToS](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service)
(extracted from the [paper](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3977/OPAL2025-10.pdf)):

I still want to check how some of these terms can be added to [DPV](https://w3id.org/dpv#),
as well as how to integrate the usage of terms that are already in DPV, i.e., 
[DPV's location extension](https://w3id.org/dpv/loc#) would be great to re-use for identifying countries and
unions such as the [European Union](https://w3id.org/dpv/loc#EU).

#### Formal semantics of ODRL

My second highlight goes to work being done on a [formal semantics for ODRL](https://w3c.github.io/odrl/formal-semantics/).
On this topic, there were two especially interesting works being presented:
- *Piero Andrea Bonatti, Nicoletta Fornara, and Andreas Harth*,
["Towards a Formal Semantics of the Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL 2.2)"](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3977/OPAL2025-4.pdf), and
- *Andrea Cimmino, Nicoletta Fornara*,
["Improving ODRL 2.2: current limitations and theoretical solutions"](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3977/OPAL2025-6.pdf)

[Bonatti *et al.*](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3977/OPAL2025-4.pdf) focused on the *current informal semantics* of ODRL
and provide first steps for a *declarative semantics* of ODRL, namely looking at how to formalize
- constraint operators,
- left operands and world states,
- permissions and prohibitions without duties and remedies,
- introducing temporal constraints to comply with duties,
amongst others.

As for [Cimmino and Fornara]((https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3977/OPAL2025-6.pdf)),
they highlighted gaps on ODRL to be solved on a *future version 3.0*,
categorising them in terms of *descriptive* and *behavioural* semantics,
and offered a series of proposals to tackle them, namely by:
- Refining the operands, operators and actions in the [ODRL vocabulary](https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-vocab/)
- Introducing and describing the concept of state of the world as a Knowledge Graph
- Introducing a *policy status* concept
- Extending ODRL to support the specification of various types of policies
- Introducing SPARQL-based evaluation rules
- Introducing the notion of policy templates & variables

### Interoperable policy engines at ESWC

Not at OPAL, but also related to policies,
in the [main conference](https://2025.eswc-conferences.org/),
we presented our latest work, led by [Wout Slabbinck](https://woutslabbinck.com),
on [interoperable policy engines](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-94578-6_11)
(check out an [open-access version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/woutslabbinck/papers/main/2025/Interoperable-Interpretation-and-Evaluation-of-ODRL-Policies.pdf)).

This paper proposes a systematic approach to evaluating ODRL policies,
looking at the [formal semantics for ODRL draft specification](https://w3c.github.io/odrl/formal-semantics/),
to enable meaningful negotiation over privacy preferences on the Web,
introducing a [Compliance Report Model](https://w3id.org/force/compliance-report), 
a [test suite](https://w3id.org/force/test-suite/repo),
and our very own implementation of an [ODRL Evaluator](https://w3id.org/force/evaluator)
to support accurate, interoperable, and enforceable policy interpretations in line with regulatory requirements.

We got very good feedback to make future improvements to the work,
also in the form of a ðŸŒŸ nomination for best resource paper ðŸŒŸ,
and are currently in discussions to integrate the [Compliance Report Model](https://w3id.org/force/compliance-report)
in the work being done on the [ODRL formal semantics specification](https://w3c.github.io/odrl/formal-semantics/)
by the [W3C ODRL CG](https://www.w3.org/community/odrl/).

Quite recently we also started to work on a [demo](https://w3id.org/force/ESWC2025-demo)
that allows users to test this work on the Web.
More on that on a future post ðŸ˜œ

### Looking towards the future

That's a wrap! I'm looking forward to seeing what the second half of 2025 (and 2026) brings us in terms of work
on policies and particular on ODRL.
