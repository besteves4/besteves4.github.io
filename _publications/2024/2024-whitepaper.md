abstract: >-
  The <a href="https://docs.kantarainitiative.org/uma/wg/rec-oauth-uma-grant-2.0.html" target="_blank">User-Managed Access (UMA)</a> extension to <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.17487/RFC6749" target="_blank">OAuth 2.0</a> is a promising candidate for increasing Digital Trust in personal data ecosystems like <a href="https://solidproject.org/" target="_blank">Solid</a>. With minor modifications, it can achieve many requirements regarding usage control and transaction contextualization, even though additional specification is needed to address delegation of control and retraction of usage policies.
