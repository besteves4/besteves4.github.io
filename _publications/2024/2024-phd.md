  The rapid growth of data and its integration into daily life has raised significant legal and ethical concerns, especially since the enforcement of the GDPR in 2018. This thesis aims to help users manage the complexity of their data rights by providing Web services that align with their privacy preferences and legal protections. It explores the use of data protection vocabularies and machine-readable policy languages to represent privacy requirements and support GDPR compliance, including auditing and rights management. A policy-matching algorithm is introduced to control access to decentralised personal datastores like Solid Pods, giving users greater control over who accesses their data. The work demonstrates that Semantic Web technologies can effectively express data protection rules, enhance transparency, and support evolving data governance needs.<br>
