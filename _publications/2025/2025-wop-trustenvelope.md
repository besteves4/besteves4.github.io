  This paper argues that raw data exchange is costly and risky due to missing mechanisms for expressing data usage conditions, provenance, and lawful use constraints. It introduces the <a href="https://w3id.org/trustenvelope" target="_blank">Trust Envelope model</a>, which encapsulates data with contextual information about its history and intended use to reduce risk, incentivize compliant exchanges, and support controlled, trust-based data sharing.
