abstract: >-
  The digitalisation of healthcare data offers significant benefits but also introduces interoperability, regulatory, and compliance challenges — particularly under the newly-introduced <a href="http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2025/327/oj/eng" target="_blank">European Health Data Space (EHDS) Regulation</a> — which this article addresses by proposing a machine-readable policy framework using <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-model/" target="_blank">ODRL</a> and <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv" target="_blank">DPV</a>, along with an agreement instantiation specification to enable trustworthy and interoperable health data exchange.
keywords: Health data exchange, machine-readable policies, agreement instantiation, regulatory compliance, GDPR, EHDS
