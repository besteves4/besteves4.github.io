  This paper addresses gaps in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-model/" target="_blank">ODRL</a> by proposing ontology design patterns to formally represent <a href="https://w3id.org/force/sotw" target="_blank">evaluation requests and contextual state of the world information</a> needed for transparent and accountable ODRL policy evaluation. Hence, this work on inputs for ODRL evaluation is being discussed to be integrated into the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/odrl/formal-semantics/" target="_blank">formal semantics specification</a> being developed in the context of the W3C ODRL Community Group.

keywords: Policy evaluation, access and usage policies, context, evaluation requests, state of the world, ODRL
