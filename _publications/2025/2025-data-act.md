  This article analyzes the EU <a href="http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2023/2854/oj" target="_blank">Data Act</a>'s requirements for multiparty data access in connected products, proposes a conceptual model supported by technologies like identity and consent management to deal with these requirements, and illustrates its application through an “agentic home” use case that combines <a href="https://solidproject.org/" target="_blank">personal data stores</a> with generative AI to promote ethical innovation and EU competitiveness.
